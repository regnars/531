5/3/1 planner.
===

This is a repository for source code of Jim Wendler's "5/3/1" strength program planning chrome extension.

I was tired of spending too much time on the calculations of my mesocycle using my calculator and excel. 
So I built this application that helped me planning out my "5/3/1" mesocycles. 

Hopefully it will make other lifters' lives a bit easier.

If you want a manual on how to use this extension, you should buy, read and understand Jim's book first.

The extension was built using: 
  - Angular JS - http://angularjs.org/,
  - Bootstrap - http://getbootstrap.com/,
  - Angular local storage - https://github.com/grevory/angular-local-storage
  - "5/3/1" 2nd edition book by Jim Wendler - http://store.jimwendler.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=5312edebook

You can download extension from Chrome web store - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/531-planner/aeaclelajhamgcmngdjlnpjjkggbcbbh 
or just by downloading "531 Chrome extension.crx" file from repository and dragging it into your chrome://extensions window.

Disclaimer:
The application is built by me but I do not own "5/3/1" logo and the "5/3/1" strength program itself. All rights belong to their rightful owners.

I do not make any profit of this extension whatsoever. This software is free and will stay free.
