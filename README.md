5/3/1 planner.
===

This is a repository for source code of Jim Wendler's "5/3/1" strength program planning web application.

Application is built using: 
  - ASP.NET MVC 5 - http://www.asp.net/vnext/overview/aspnet-mvc
  - Angular JS - http://angularjs.org/,
  - Bootstrap - http://getbootstrap.com/,
  - Angular local storage - https://github.com/grevory/angular-local-storage
  - "5/3/1" 2nd edition book by Jim Wendler - http://store.jimwendler.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=5312edebook

Chrome extension does not use asp.net MVC and uses plain html instead.
